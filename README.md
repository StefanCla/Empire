# Empire
Third school projec tthat i worked on to get more familiar with cross-platform development & team work.
This project has been made in collaberation with Justin Kujawa (https://github.com/Contingencyy).

The project is a small turn-based strategy game with a space theme.
The player is able to move a space ship to a planet to occupy it. The AI will also occupy planets until there are no more available.

The project has no win-lose condition due to the limited time we had for the project.
This project was 4 weeks solo and 4 weeks in collaboration.

This project supports the Windows & Linux platform.
